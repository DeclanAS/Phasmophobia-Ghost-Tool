# Phasmophobia Ghost Determining Tool Site

## How To Use:

### Evidence (1-3):
Add in the evidence you currently have from the list of six possible choices.

### Evidence Not Found (Optional):
If you are certain one of the pieces of evidence is nowhere to be found in the building, you can also add an option to deduce the ghost type.

### Click Submit:
All possible ghost types will appear below.

### Ending note:
I found out too little too late that Github pages only supports static websites, so this php file does not show on the site itself. But the websites source code is here for viewing nonetheless.
